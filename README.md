# Influenza-Season-Staffing_CareerFoundry
This repository contains all the data from my Achievement 1+2 at CareerFoundry, the Influenza Project.

## Introduction
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

## Objectives and Goals
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

## Glossary
Influenza: a contagious viral infection, often causing fever and aches.

Vulnerable populations: patients likely to develop flu complications requiring additional care, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These include adults over 65 years, children under 5 years, and pregnant women, as well as individuals with HIV/AIDs, cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma, and children with neurological disorders.
